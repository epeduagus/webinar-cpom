#'
#' http://finance-r.com/cpom/
#' 
#' In the first part of this Webinar we review the most common ways to conduct 
#' the task of portfolio optimization with R. After this introduction, which can 
#' be of use for anyone interested in portfolio opimization in general, some 
#' remarks on the modeling of portfolio problems will be addressed. In the second 
#' part, a revolutionary way to model and solve portfolio optimization problems 
#' using R will be shown. The basic idea of conceptualizing a new way to model 
#' portfolio optimization problems is to build a portfolio optimization modeling 
#' language on top of a generalized algebraic modeling language. By focussing on 
#' a number of different modeling and optimization approaches, the Webinar is 
#' going to provide new insights for a broad range of interested parties.
